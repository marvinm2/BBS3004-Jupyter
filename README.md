# README: BBS3004-Jupyter Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the BBS3004-Jupyter repository. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the SPARQL project of the BBS3004 course for the academic year 2024-2025. The course introduces students to Python programming, executing SPARQL queries against biomedical databases, and visualizing the results.

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an introduction to Python and demonstrates how to retrieve and manipulate data using SPARQL queries. The goal is to help users understand how to work with SPARQL endpoints, extract data, and process it using pandas DataFrames.

## Contents

### 1. Python Basics
- Variables, data types, and operations
- Lists, loops, and dictionaries
- Functions and control structures

### 2. SPARQL Queries in Python
- Introduction to SPARQL and RDF data
- Using `SPARQLWrapper` to send queries to a SPARQL endpoint
- Executing queries and retrieving results

### 3. Handling Data with Pandas
- Converting SPARQL query results into pandas DataFrames
- Exploring DataFrames: viewing columns, filtering rows
- Merging additional SPARQL query results into the main DataFrame

### 4. Ranking and Visualizing Data
- Sorting pathways based on the number of data nodes
- Displaying top pathways in a DataFrame
- Visualizing ranked pathways using `matplotlib`
- Visualizing number of DataNodes using `seaborn`

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Intro_Python_SPARQL.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells sequentially to explore Python basics and SPARQL queries.
3. Modify SPARQL queries to retrieve different datasets.
4. Use pandas functions to analyze and visualize the data.

For questions or modifications, feel free to explore and adapt the notebook!
